Ancient labyrinths filled with puzzles, traps, and monsters, mystical towers stretching into the sky above, cavern systems echoing with the sounds of distant danger; all of these and more are considered dungeons. A dungeon has come to mean just about any natural or artificial complex full of treasures and dangers. But to you, a dungeon means even more than that. A dungeon is also who you are...</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While most dungeons, no matter how magical, are nothing more than buildings or natural formations, some dungeons are special. Through a set of strange circumstances, sometimes a dungeon awakens to sentience, and then to full sapience, after gaining a life force and soul. This could have been something the dungeon gained on its own, as an aftereffect of either the spirit of the dungeon's builder or vitae (\"so-called nature spirits\") for natural dungeons. Alternatively, it could have happened when the dungeon's core, heart, or focal point absorbed the life force and spirit of an adventuring interloper or dungeon denizen. However a dungeon's awakening occurred, an awakened dungeon is a living, albeit unusual, creature, with an enormous body shaped out of stone or other material and arteries and veins made up of magical conduits or ley lines.</p>\n<p>Of course, awakened dungeons can't get much done outside of their own environs if they leave it at that. So eventually, each awakened dungeon becomes able to manifest an avatar; it's a rite of passage for awakened dungeons, similar to reaching adulthood for other creatures. This avatar is formed from the dungeon's core and appears to be a member of a humanoid ancestry. At the same time, the awakened dungeon becomes extradimensional, if it wasn't already, inextricably linking access to the dungeon to the avatar's whims. A dungeon's avatar can even leave the dungeon and explore the world, much like any other character.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is also secretly (or overtly) a dungeon that only you, and the ones you choose, can enter, you should play a dungeon...</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Be extremely interested in learning about the architectural styles and aesthetics of other dungeons, even blushing at times when you see an extremely beautifully designed dungeon.</li>\n<li>Treat even unawakened dungeons with great respect, glaring at comrades whose solution to a maze is to bash down the wall with an adamantine pickaxe. You never know if the dungeon will awaken later, and it's just good manners.</li>\n<li>At times seem distant and detached to others who are used to thinking as a single person, rather than an entire dungeon.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't realize that your avatar isn't just \"you\" without being reminded constantly.</li>\n<li>Are highly confused when you try to tell them that you are really a dungeon, even after an explanation.</li>\n<li>Appreciate the hidden mysteries you show them, once you trust them enough to let them in.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Dungeon avatars look like normal members of the ancestry they appear to be, though there is usually an unusual feature or two that gives a hint as to the true nature of the dungeon within. As to the dungeons themselves, their physical appearances vary dramatically between heritages, and even within the same heritage, from dungeon to dungeon. No two are alike.</p>\n<h2>The Dungeon Within</h2>\n<p>An awakened dungeon is composed of several progressively more challenging layers, which are called \"floors\" even if they aren't arranged as floors in a traditional sense (such as for an archipelago dungeon, where they are islands). In order to complete the dungeon, an adventurer must complete each of the floors in order, earning rewards as they do so. For most awakened dungeons, the floors are reflective of some aspect of the dungeon's inner self, soul, hidden past, or some other secret. Whether the dungeon manifested a personality first, and the floors changed to suit their inner self, or whether their inner self was shaped by the floors, is a question as difficult to determine as the chicken and the egg.</p>\n<p>An awakened dungeon can send their avatar in and out of their own extradimensional dungeon in order to challenge a floor of the dungeon through a process that takes an hour of concentration. They can additionally bring along allies, as long as they are all holding hands or otherwise physically connected in a circle throughout the process. It's always possible to leave the dungeon in this way, but the ability to enter is much more limited. Normally, a dungeon and their allies can only enter the dungeon to challenge one of the floors from a safe, stable location after a full day of rest. The GM might determine that the dungeon's avatar is able to enter the dungeon in other circumstances as well. After spending an hour retreating and leaving the dungeon, or after clearing a dungeon floor, an awakened dungeon and any allies they brought are sent back to the same spot where they entered the dungeon. Additionally, if you die, the dungeon loses all consciousness and ejects your remaining allies, as well as your avatar's corpse, back to the Material Plane.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Dungeons can be of any alignment, and their alignment is usually completely unrelated to the alignment of any monsters within the dungeon. If they obtained their life force and spirit from another creature, they often have an alignment similar to that creature. This is especially true if they unlock more of their previous self by clearing floors.</p>\n<p>Similarly, dungeons worship all sorts of deities for all sorts of reasons. Depending on the type of dungeon, natural dungeons might have a slight tendency to worship a nature deity, and artificial dungeons might lean towards a deity associated with doorways, thresholds, transitions, or crafting. Tower dungeons might worship a deity of knowledge, and labyrinth dungeons might worship a deity of tricks and riddles.</p>\n<h2>Name</h2>\n<p>Dungeons have three major tendencies when it comes to names. They typically either keep the name that others commonly called the dungeon before they awakened, give themselves a mighty and impressive sounding dungeon name, or adopt a name more suited to their avatar's form.</p>\n<h2>Sample Names</h2>\n<p>Acheron, Elysia, Hal, Gehenna, Portia, Steve, The Azure Depths, The Crystalline Caverns, The Great Sage Tree, The Twisting Labyrinth.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Battlezoo Ancestries: Dungeons"},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"rare","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.782,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-09-07T21:24:18.429-04:00","version":{"schema":0.734,"foundry":"10.284","system":"4.0.0-beta2"}}},"hp":10,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["con"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":["abyssal","aklo","celestial","draconic","dwarven","elven","infernal","sylvan"],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"lowLightVision"},"ownership":{"default":0,"SJBWQ2yDJjdAEBHl":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.0.0-alpha1","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":1662600258432,"modifiedTime":1662600290488,"lastModifiedBy":"SKExkWfRuNeJGNaH"}}
